This website display showcases a combination of well-structured HTML and modern CSS techniques to achieve a responsive and visually engaging layout.

1.HTML Foundation: The underlying structure is likely built using HTML elements, creating clear sections for headers, content areas, and image containers. This separation of content and presentation allows for clean and maintainable code.

2.CSS Styling: CSS takes center stage in defining the visual appearance of the website. We have leveraged properties like: a)Flexbox: This layout model provides flexibility in arranging elements horizontally or vertically. It is used to position elements within sections or align content within the main content area. b)Grid Layout: This powerful layout system creates complex grid structures with rows and columns. Various sections of the code have utilized a grid layout with two columns, one for text and another for images. This ensures a well-organized and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

3.Image Integration: The images displayed on the website were created using Figma, a popular design tool. These images were then incorporated into the HTML using the  tag with references to their file paths within the /IMAGES folder.

4.Code Clarity: By relying solely on HTML and CSS, we have achieved a clean and maintainable codebase. This makes it easier to understand, modify, and scale the website in the future.
